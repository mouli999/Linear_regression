# Linear_regression
Did analysis which help in understanding what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables

Column Profiling:

Serial No. (Unique row ID)
GRE Scores (out of 340)
TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
University Rating (out of 5)
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)

Steps followed:
1.Imported the dataset and did exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset.

2.Use Non-graphical and graphical analysis for getting inferences about variables.

3.Checked correlation among independent variables and how they interacted with each other.

4.Used Linear Regression from (Statsmodel library) and explained the parameters.

5.Tested the assumptions of linear regression like 
  Multicollinearity check by VIF score,  Mean of residuals,
  Linearity of variables, 
  Test for Homoscedasticity,  Normality of residuals
  
Did model evaluation- MAE, RMSE, R2 score, Adjusted R2.
